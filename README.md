## Introduction

I used the following list of questions as a starting point when trying to decide
whom to marry. Most of the questions were given to me by a good friend who is
vastly more experienced with relationships. I customised it to make it my own.

Some questions you can ask your partner directly. Others you should try to
answer yourself by observing your partner over some time. This is not an
exhaustive list, and everyone is different, so you should only use this as an
inspiration and adapt it according to your needs. Bear in mind that you will
never find anyone who gives you perfect answers. The key is to understand where
you can compromise and where you cannot.

Good luck!
