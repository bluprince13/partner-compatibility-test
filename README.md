Sadly this is not exhaustive and everyone is different. I think it’s important
to pick out which qualities you can deal with and which ones you cannot do
without. We have to keep in mind no ones perfect but maybe some of these will be
useful to you.

I think one of the major things is priorities. In my opinion people change and
that's because their priorities change. If an individual understands what their
priorities should be. And remain loyal and fixed to those priorities rather than
changed to their liking. I think there’s a higher chance that person remains in
a long lasting relationship with a like minded individual.
